# Udemy - Advanced CSS and SASS - Natours project, coding along

This is a training repository for the course [*"Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!"*](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) that I am taking on Udemy.

The code in this repository is my coding along with the instuctor (Jonas Schmedtmann). 

After completing this particular project with the instructor, I intend to make my own repo with a few corrections if I have any.

The link to that repo will be posted here after completion.
